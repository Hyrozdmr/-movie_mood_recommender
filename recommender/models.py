# This defines a new class called Movie, which inherits from models.Model. 
# In Django, all models inherit from models.Model, 
# which is part of Djangoâ€™s ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). 
# This allows Django to automatically handle interactions between the Python code and the database

# The field is a CharField, which means it will store text data.
# The max_length=200 specifies that the maximum number of characters for the movie title is 200. 
# This helps prevent excessively long titles from being stored in the database.
